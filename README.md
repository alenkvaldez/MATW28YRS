# Me Against The World 28th Anniversary
Me Against the World is 2Pacâ€™s third studio album, released on March 14, 1995 through Interscope Records. This album was created in 1994, the year he was shot outside Quad Recording Studios in New York City (as discussed on the intro) and sent to prison.

On his third album, the stressed-out West Coast poet turned a critical eye from his bleak surroundings to his own conflicted psyche. Me Against the World marks 2Pac's official shift from gangsta to philosopher, sacrificing none of the rebellion.

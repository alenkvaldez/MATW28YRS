# Me Against The World 28th Anniversary
A look back at 2pac's third studio album, Me Against the World, released on March 14, 1995 through Interscope Records.

On his third album, the stressed-out West Coast poet turned a critical eye from his bleak surroundings to his own conflicted psyche. Me Against the World marks 2Pac's official shift from gangsta to philosopher, sacrificing none of the rebellion.

# Me Against The World 28th Anniversary
Me Against the World is 2Pacâ€™s third studio album, released on March 14, 1995 through Interscope Records.

On his third album, the stressed-out West Coast poet turned a critical eye from his bleak surroundings to his own conflicted psyche. Me Against the World marks 2Pac's official shift from gangsta to philosopher, sacrificing none of the rebellion.

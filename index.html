        <h2>Epigraph</h2>
        <p> "<i>Me Against the World</i> was really to show people that this is an art to me. That I do take it like that. And whatever mistakes I make, I make out of ignorance, not out of disrespect to music or the art. So Me Against the World was deep, reflective. 
        </p>

        <p>
          It was like a blues record. It was down-home. It was all my fears, all the things I just couldn’t sleep about. Everybody thought that I was living so well and doing so good that I wanted to explain it. And it took a whole album to get it all out.
        </p>

        <p>
          It’s explaining my lifestyle, who I am, my upbringing and everything. It talks about the streets but talks about it in a different light. There’s a song on there dedicated to mothers, just a song I wrote just for my mother. And it digs deeper like that. I just wanted to do wanted to something for all mothers. I’m proud of that song. It affected a lot of people."

        <h2>Mise-En-Scène</h2>

        <p>
          About 300 miles north of Manhattan sits the Clinton Correctional Facility, a maximum-security prison that, in 1995, housed its most famous inmate: Tupac Amaru Shakur. He had been sentenced to one and a half to four and a half years in a sexual assault trial the previous fall. On top of normal psychological torture that comes with imprisonment, Pac was also having trouble sleeping. In November of the previous year—the night before a jury convicted him—he was shot in the lobby of a Manhattan recording studio. “I have headaches,” he’d later tell Vibe. “I wake up screaming. I’ve been having nightmares, thinking they’re still shooting me.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Tupac`s world was set ablaze in a fiery inferno that burned with such a fury that for most it would have surely been a harbinger of a certain end. However, Tupac was one of a kind – he arose from the ashes like a great Phoenix and spread his wings with renewed strength and breath of life. And from the charred remains of his past – the shooting, the trial, and the media storm that pinned him inside the prison cell at New York’s Clinton Correctional Facility he made the groundwork for his magnum opus, his final message – “Me Against the World”.
        </p>

        <p>
          But outside of prison, he was becoming a superstar. In March of ’95, Interscope released Pac’s third album, Me Against the World. It’s a remarkable record, at turns tender and fatalistic. There are fever dreams of the golden age in New York City; he mulls suicide and perches by windows with AKs. The album went immediately to No. 1.
        </p>

        <p>
          Pac’s greatest strength as a writer was his ability to isolate emotions: to identify them within himself, to evoke them in listeners, and to convincingly ascribe them to the characters he rendered, be they imaginary Brendas or caricatured Biggies. While he was an endlessly complex individual, Pac liked to choose one gut feeling and blow it up to its technicolor extreme—never to the point where it became unbelievable, but he had little interest in hedging himself or tacking on qualifiers. On MATW, that impulse, combined with the pace and method and recording (and with his legal situation, and with his mounting paranoia), made for an alchemic blend of horror, fate, and defiance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Weighty issues are handled sensitively and compassionately throughout Me Against The World, an album often considered to be 2Pac’s finest. Be that as it may, 2Pac wasn’t exactly known for his subtlety, and as such, the street violence on Me Against The World is depicted with far less nuance. This mix of drama, tragedy, tenderness, nostalgia, hatred, darkness, love and countless other emotions add up to an all-round excellent album, one that only a talent as unique as Tupac Amaru Shakur could have pulled off so well.

        <h2>Enjambment</h2>

        <!-- <h3>McDonalds</h3> -->
        <p>
          In August 1996, just two weeks before his assassination, Pac was doing a press junket for Gang Related, the last movie he would ever act in. Someone asked him about his name. He talked about a man named Tupac Amaru II, who in 1780 led a revolt against Spanish colonists and what was effectively an economy of slave labor that exploited the native populations. In the centuries since, the uprising has been mythologized by some of those fighting for indigenous rights or independence throughout Latin America; in his own time, Amaru was marred by rumors of his uneven control over the rebels, with stories of brutal looting and violence dirtying his reputation and eroding support.
        </p>
        <!-- <h3>Burger King</h3> -->
        <p>
          Eventually, two of his officers betrayed him, and he was captured. He was sentenced to watch his wife, son, and other relatives be executed, after which he was to be drawn and quartered in the town square. His tongue would be cut out and his severed head would be displayed on a stake.
        </p>
        <!-- <h3>Taco Bell</h3> -->
        <p>
          Pac talked about this—the revolution, the betrayal, the execution. Then he composed himself. “People ask me what my name means, and I don’t tell ’em like Tupac Amaru,” he said. “I just say it means ‘determined,’ because I’m determined to never, ever negotiate again.”
        </p>
        <!-- <h3>Taco Bell</h3> -->
        <p>
          All Eyez on Me was likewise without compromise—an exhaustive survey of Tupac’s brain matter at the most harrowing time in his young life. It captures him at his most vulnerable and provocative. He executes an array of styles at an almost impossibly high skill level that never feels like an exercise in form. What could have been (and perhaps what was) a creative work made out of obligation turned into a bloodletting, a remarkable final document from one of his era’s defining voices.
        </p>
        <!-- <h3>Taco Bell</h3> -->
        <p>
          And yet for all the mania and fury, the best revenge Tupac exacted against enemies—those real and imagined—came when he was at his coolest and most controlled. Tucked into the back half of the second All Eyez on Me disc, “Picture Me Rollin’” is that proverbial eye of the storm. Pac opens the song rapping about frayed nerves and federal surveillance, then cedes the floor to CPO and Big Syke for several minutes. When he comes back in, it’s for a satisfied, almost tranquil monologue. He’s waving at Clinton Correctional from the outside—he sneers at the punk police, the crooked C.O.s. The District Attorney who tried his case is “that bitch.” He wants to know: Can you see me? Can you see me from there?
        </p>
        <!-- <h3>Taco Bell</h3> -->
        <p>
          But his last words take on a sort of phantom quality. Pac’s surely talking to the guards who wish he was still under their thumb when he says: “Anytime y’all wanna see me again, rewind this track right here. Picture me rollin.”
